HOW TO RUN THE BUILD SCRIPT
========================================

If the build script closes immediately when you double-click it, use one of these methods:

METHOD 1: Use START_BUILD.bat (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------------------------
1. Double-click: START_BUILD.bat
   - This wrapper keeps the window open so you can see any errors

METHOD 2: Run from Command Prompt
----------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to: cd C:\porfolio\render-confirmlicense\01_SOURCE_CODE
3. Run: build_cxfreeze.bat

METHOD 3: Right-Click and Select
----------------------------------
1. Right-click on build_cxfreeze.bat
2. Select "Run as administrator" or "Open with Command Prompt"

METHOD 4: If you get "Access is denied" errors
-----------------------------------------------
1. First run: cleanup_build_folder.bat
2. Wait for it to complete
3. Then run: START_BUILD.bat

TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

If the window still closes immediately:
- Check if Python is installed: Open Command Prompt and type "python --version"
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Try running from Command Prompt instead of double-clicking

The START_BUILD.bat file will keep the window open so you can see what's happening.
