## üìù **Best Practices**

### **Manual License Creation**
- **Always add notes** explaining why the license was created
- **Set appropriate expiration dates** - don't create perpetual licenses
- **Use consistent naming** for license types
- **Keep records** of manual licenses for accounting

### **License Revocation**
- **Always provide a reason** for revocation
- **Notify customers** before revoking (unless for fraud)
- **Keep revocation records** for customer service
- **Consider refunds** for recent purchases

### **General Management**
- **Regular audits** - Review licenses periodically
- **Customer communication** - Keep customers informed
- **Documentation** - Record all manual actions
- **Backup procedures** - Ensure data is backed up

## üö® **Important Considerations**

### **Manual vs. Stripe Licenses**
- **Manual licenses** don't create Stripe charges
- **Stripe licenses** are automatically created via webhooks
- **Both types** use the same validation system
- **Both types** can be revoked the same way

### **Customer Experience**
- **Manual licenses** require you to send the license key
- **Stripe licenses** are automatically emailed
- **Revocation** affects both types immediately
- **Activation** works the same for both types

### **Accounting and Billing**
- **Manual licenses** may need separate billing
- **Stripe licenses** are automatically billed
- **Revocation** doesn't automatically refund Stripe charges
- **Consider refunds** for revoked Stripe licenses

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

4. **Check your admin key** is correct
