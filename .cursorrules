# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The license management system implements a hardware-locked commercial licensing solution with tiered access control and multi-stage validation.

## Core System Components

### License Management Server (server.mjs)
Importance Score: 85/100

Handles license generation and validation using a three-part key structure:
```
{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}
```

Implements tiered licensing models:
- Student Annual
- Startup Monthly
- Professional (Monthly/Yearly)
- Enterprise (Monthly/Yearly) 
- Integration Annual
- White-label Annual

### Client-Side License Validation (CONFIRM_Integrated.py)
Importance Score: 75/100

Manages hardware binding and local license verification:
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address
- License state management (active/expired/pending)
- Secure local license caching
- Multi-step validation workflow

## Business Logic Integration

The system connects through key verification points:

1. License Generation
- Tier-specific durations and pricing
- Optional manual approval requirements
- Hardware fingerprint binding

2. License Validation Chain
- Local cache verification
- Hardware signature matching
- Server-side validation
- Expiration enforcement

3. Access Control
- Single machine activation enforcement
- Tiered feature access
- Time-based expiration
- Manual approval workflows for enterprise licenses

The system prioritizes secure license binding through hardware fingerprinting while supporting flexible license tiers and validation workflows.

The system implements a hardware-bound licensing solution integrated with statistical analysis capabilities, organized into two core business components:
## License Management Core (Importance: 85/100)
`server.mjs`
- License Generation System
  - Hardware fingerprint-based binding
  - Multi-factor validation (licenseId, expiry, cryptographic signature)
  - Tiered access control (Student/Startup/Professional/Enterprise)
- License State Workflow
  - Progressive states from creation through activation
  - Machine-specific binding verification
  - Offline grace period handling
## Statistical Analysis Engine (Importance: 75/100)
`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`
- Hardware Identity System
  - Multi-factor machine fingerprinting
    - CPU identification
    - Motherboard serial tracking
    - Network interface binding
    - BIOS verification
- Analysis Workflow
  - Multi-sheet data processing
  - Statistical validation rules
  - Professional-grade analysis pipeline
The system combines secure license management with statistical processing capabilities, ensuring that licensed features are accessible only to validated installations bound to specific hardware configurations.

The license management system consists of two core components:

## Protection System
Located in `/01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, and MAC address
- Multi-layer license protection with runtime integrity verification
- Anti-debugging and virtual machine detection
- Time-based execution controls
Importance Score: 85

## License Administration
Located in `/01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`
- Hardware-bound license generation and management
- Multi-tier license handling (student, startup, professional, enterprise)
- License revocation system with audit capabilities
- Status verification and expiration management
Importance Score: 75

## Core Business Rules
- Hardware-bound licenses with permanent machine association
- Multi-layered validation preventing license transfers
- Tiered access system with feature-based restrictions
- Automatic termination on tampering detection
- Dual verification through local and server checks

## License Server Implementation
- Hybrid key format with embedded signatures
- HMAC-SHA256 based license validation
- Migration pathway for legacy license formats
- Comprehensive state management (active, revoked, migrated)
- Historical tracking of license changes
Importance Score: 85
