# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The license management system implements a hardware-locked commercial licensing solution with tiered access control and multi-stage validation.

## Core System Components

### License Management Server (server.mjs)
Importance Score: 85/100

Handles license generation and validation using a three-part key structure:
```
{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}
```

Implements tiered licensing models:
- Student Annual
- Startup Monthly
- Professional (Monthly/Yearly)
- Enterprise (Monthly/Yearly) 
- Integration Annual
- White-label Annual

### Client-Side License Validation (CONFIRM_Integrated.py)
Importance Score: 75/100

Manages hardware binding and local license verification:
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address
- License state management (active/expired/pending)
- Secure local license caching
- Multi-step validation workflow

## Business Logic Integration

The system connects through key verification points:

1. License Generation
- Tier-specific durations and pricing
- Optional manual approval requirements
- Hardware fingerprint binding

2. License Validation Chain
- Local cache verification
- Hardware signature matching
- Server-side validation
- Expiration enforcement

3. Access Control
- Single machine activation enforcement
- Tiered feature access
- Time-based expiration
- Manual approval workflows for enterprise licenses

The system prioritizes secure license binding through hardware fingerprinting while supporting flexible license tiers and validation workflows.

The system implements a hardware-bound licensing solution integrated with statistical analysis capabilities, organized into two core business components:

## License Management Core (Importance: 85/100)
`server.mjs`

- License Generation System
  - Hardware fingerprint-based binding
  - Multi-factor validation (licenseId, expiry, cryptographic signature)
  - Tiered access control (Student/Startup/Professional/Enterprise)

- License State Workflow
  - Progressive states from creation through activation
  - Machine-specific binding verification
  - Offline grace period handling

## Statistical Analysis Engine (Importance: 75/100)
`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`

- Hardware Identity System
  - Multi-factor machine fingerprinting
    - CPU identification
    - Motherboard serial tracking
    - Network interface binding
    - BIOS verification

- Analysis Workflow
  - Multi-sheet data processing
  - Statistical validation rules
  - Professional-grade analysis pipeline

The system combines secure license management with statistical processing capabilities, ensuring that licensed features are accessible only to validated installations bound to specific hardware configurations.
