# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The license management system implements a hardware-locked commercial licensing solution with tiered access control and multi-stage validation.

## Core System Components

### License Management Server (server.mjs)
Importance Score: 85/100

Handles license generation and validation using a three-part key structure:
```
{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}
```

Implements tiered licensing models:
- Student Annual
- Startup Monthly
- Professional (Monthly/Yearly)
- Enterprise (Monthly/Yearly) 
- Integration Annual
- White-label Annual

### Client-Side License Validation (CONFIRM_Integrated.py)
Importance Score: 75/100

Manages hardware binding and local license verification:
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address
- License state management (active/expired/pending)
- Secure local license caching
- Multi-step validation workflow

## Business Logic Integration

The system connects through key verification points:

1. License Generation
- Tier-specific durations and pricing
- Optional manual approval requirements
- Hardware fingerprint binding

2. License Validation Chain
- Local cache verification
- Hardware signature matching
- Server-side validation
- Expiration enforcement

3. Access Control
- Single machine activation enforcement
- Tiered feature access
- Time-based expiration
- Manual approval workflows for enterprise licenses

The system prioritizes secure license binding through hardware fingerprinting while supporting flexible license tiers and validation workflows.

The project implements a specialized license protection and management system for statistical software applications with three core business components:

1. License Protection Engine (85/100)
Primary file: `protection_module.py`
- Hardware-based fingerprinting using CPU, motherboard and MAC identifiers
- Statistical software-specific anti-debugging mechanisms 
- Runtime integrity validation for commercial licenses
- Memory protection specialized for statistical data processing

2. License Management Server (80/100)
Primary file: `server.mjs`
- Statistical software license tier management:
  - Student/Academic licensing
  - Professional/Enterprise licensing
  - OEM/Integration licensing
- Hardware-bound license activation
- Statistical workstation-specific validation
- Custom key generation using hardware fingerprints

3. Statistical Analysis Integration (75/100)
Primary file: `license_manager_gui.py`
- License state management for statistical features
- Computational resource access control
- Statistical workflow integration
- Workstation-specific license binding

The system architecture focuses on:
- License tiers mapped to statistical capabilities
- Protection of proprietary statistical algorithms
- Academic vs commercial use case handling
- Computational resource access management
- Integration with statistical processing workflows

Core business workflows:
1. Hardware-bound license activation
2. Statistical feature access control
3. Runtime integrity monitoring
4. License tier enforcement
5. Academic/Commercial validation

The solution provides domain-specific protection for statistical analysis software through hardware-bound licensing and tiered access control to computational resources and analysis capabilities.
