A professional machine learning model validation tool that transforms clustering analysis results into statistical validation metrics. CONFIRM specializes in validating Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and other clustering algorithms by converting neuron assignments into confusion matrices and calculating comprehensive performance statistics.

## What CONFIRM Does

### Core Functionality
- **Machine Learning Model Validation**: Converts clustering results into confusion matrices
- **SOM Performance Analysis**: Evaluates Self-Organizing Map effectiveness  
- **Statistical Metrics**: Calculates precision, recall, F1-score, Chi-square, Cramer's V
- **Visualization Suite**: Generates heatmaps, radar charts, and distribution plots
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple worksheets simultaneously

### Data Input Format
- **Excel Files (.xlsx/.xls)**: Clustering results with neurons/units and category assignments
- **Structure**: First column = Unit IDs, other columns = category types with sample counts
- **Output**: Comprehensive statistical validation reports and visualizations
