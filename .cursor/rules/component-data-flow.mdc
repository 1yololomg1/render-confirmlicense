# component-data-flow

The license management system implements a multi-directional data flow between client and server components for license validation and state management:

## License Validation Flow
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Client-Side Initialization (`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`):
- Generates hardware fingerprint from CPU/motherboard/MAC identifiers
- Checks local license cache for existing activation
- Prepares license validation request with machine signature

2. Server Validation (`server.mjs`):
- Receives client hardware signature and license key
- Validates license format: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- Verifies hardware binding against registered machines
- Returns activation status with tier information

3. State Transition Management:
- Active -> Expired: Triggered by timestamp validation
- Pending -> Active: After manual approval for Enterprise tier
- Active -> Revoked: Administrative action with reason tracking

## License Data Propagation
Importance Score: 75/100

1. Hardware Binding Flow:
- Client generates unique machine identifier
- Server stores binding in license record
- Activation status synchronized to client
- Local cache updated with binding status

2. Tier-Specific Data Handling:
- Student/Startup: Automated activation flow
- Professional: Immediate binding verification
- Enterprise: Manual approval workflow
- Integration/White-label: Custom activation rules

3. License State Synchronization:
- Client maintains local state cache
- Server pushes state changes on validation
- Expiration handling coordinated between components
- Revocation immediately propagated to all instances
