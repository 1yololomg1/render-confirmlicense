# component-data-flow

The license management system implements a multi-directional data flow between client and server components for license validation and state management:

## License Validation Flow
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Client-Side Initialization (`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`):
- Generates hardware fingerprint from CPU/motherboard/MAC identifiers
- Checks local license cache for existing activation
- Prepares license validation request with machine signature

2. Server Validation (`server.mjs`):
- Receives client hardware signature and license key
- Validates license format: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- Verifies hardware binding against registered machines
- Returns activation status with tier information

3. State Transition Management:
- Active -> Expired: Triggered by timestamp validation
- Pending -> Active: After manual approval for Enterprise tier
- Active -> Revoked: Administrative action with reason tracking

## License Data Propagation
Importance Score: 75/100

1. Hardware Binding Flow:
- Client generates unique machine identifier
- Server stores binding in license record
- Activation status synchronized to client
- Local cache updated with binding status

2. Tier-Specific Data Handling:
- Student/Startup: Automated activation flow
- Professional: Immediate binding verification
- Enterprise: Manual approval workflow
- Integration/White-label: Custom activation rules

3. License State Synchronization:
- Client maintains local state cache
- Server pushes state changes on validation
- Expiration handling coordinated between components
- Revocation immediately propagated to all instances

# Component Data Flow

## License State Flow (Importance: 85/100)

Primary flow between components:
1. Client-side hardware fingerprinting (`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`)
   - Collects hardware identifiers
   - Bundles into fingerprint package
   - Encrypts for transmission

2. Server validation (`server.mjs`)
   - Receives fingerprint package
   - Validates against stored licenses
   - Returns activation status
   - Updates license state

3. Client activation (`CONFIRM_Integrated.py`)
   - Stores encrypted activation token
   - Manages offline grace period
   - Handles revalidation cycles

## License State Transitions

1. Purchase → Created
   - Payment verification
   - License generation
   - Initial state recording

2. Created → Pending Activation
   - License key distribution
   - Hardware binding request
   - Temporary access grant

3. Pending → Hardware Bound
   - Fingerprint validation
   - Machine binding
   - Activation token generation

4. Hardware Bound → Active
   - Final validation check
   - Feature enablement
   - Usage tracking start

5. Active → Expired/Revoked
   - Time-based expiration
   - Manual revocation
   - Grace period management

## Data Exchange Points

1. Hardware Fingerprint Flow
   ```
   Client → Server
   - Hardware identifiers
   - Current license state
   - Usage metrics
   ```

2. Validation Response Flow
   ```
   Server → Client
   - Activation status
   - License parameters
   - Feature flags
   ```

3. State Update Flow
   ```
   Server → Database
   - License status changes
   - Binding records
   - Usage history
   ```
