# license-workflow

## License State Machine
- Manages license lifecycle through defined states:
  - Active: Valid and bound to hardware
  - Inactive: Temporarily disabled
  - Revoked: Permanently invalidated
  - Migrated: Converted from legacy format
  - Expired: Past termination date

## License Creation
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address 
- Tiered license types: student, startup, professional, enterprise
- Format: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation

## Validation Workflow
1. Hardware binding verification
2. Multi-layer anti-debugging checks
3. Runtime integrity validation
4. VM/sandbox environment detection
5. Time-based execution control

## License Migration
- Legacy format conversion (containing '-' character)
- Metadata preservation during migration
- Automatic expiry parsing
- Migration audit trail maintenance

## Revocation System
- Permanent license invalidation
- Automatic termination on tampering
- Audit logging of revocation events
- Real-time status reporting

Core Files:
- `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`: Hardware binding, security checks
- `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`: License administration interface

Importance Score: 85/100 (Critical business logic for software monetization)

# license-workflow
License lifecycle management system implementing a multi-stage workflow for software licensing.
## License Creation & Validation Flow (85/100)
`01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using composite identifiers:
  - CPU serial
  - Motherboard ID
  - BIOS info
  - MAC address
- License binding to hardware profile
- Session-based validation caching
- Runtime anti-tampering protection
## License Server Operations (80/100)  
`original_server.mjs`
- Secure key generation in format: licenseId:expiryDate:signature
- License tier management:
  - Student tier
  - Professional tier
  - Enterprise tier
- Multi-stage verification workflow
- License migration pathway for legacy keys
## Protection Mechanisms (75/100)
- Anti-debugging implementation
- Virtual machine detection
- Memory protection checks
- Local encrypted storage for license data
- Hardware binding validation
- Rate limiting on verification attempts
## License States & Transitions
Valid license states:
- Active
- Expired
- Revoked
- Migrated
- Pending Activation
Key transitions:
- Initial activation
- Renewal
- Hardware migration
- Tier upgrade/downgrade
- Revocation

License State Management
Importance Score: 85/100

Core License States:
1. Creation
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, BIOS serial, MAC address
- Key format: {license_id}:{expiry_date}:{signature}
- Tier-specific permission assignment (Student, Startup, Professional, Enterprise)

2. Validation
- Multi-layer hardware binding verification
- Offline grace period implementation
- Runtime monitoring for analysis tools/debugging attempts
- Virtual machine/sandbox detection

3. Revocation
- Administrative interface with role-based access
- Security token validation for admin operations
- Hardware binding violation tracking

4. Migration
- Legacy license format conversion system
- Hardware profile transfer workflow
- Tier-specific feature preservation

State Transitions:

1. Active → Grace Period
- Triggered by hardware binding mismatch
- Temporary permission maintenance
- Limited operation timeframe

2. Grace Period → Revoked
- Grace period expiration
- Hardware validation failure
- Security violation detection

3. Legacy → Current
- Format conversion process
- Hardware profile reassignment
- Permission level mapping

Primary Components:

1. Protection Module (01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py)
- Hardware fingerprint generation
- Runtime security monitoring
- Anti-tampering implementation

2. License Manager GUI (01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py)
- Administrative control interface
- Migration workflow handling
- Tier management system

3. License Server (server.mjs)
- Key generation and validation
- State transition management
- Security token handling
