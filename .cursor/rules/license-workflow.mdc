  - Expired: Past termination date

## License Creation
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address 
- Tiered license types: student, startup, professional, enterprise
- Format: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation

## Validation Workflow
1. Hardware binding verification
2. Multi-layer anti-debugging checks
3. Runtime integrity validation
4. VM/sandbox environment detection
5. Time-based execution control

## License Migration
- Legacy format conversion (containing '-' character)
- Metadata preservation during migration
- Automatic expiry parsing
- Migration audit trail maintenance

## Revocation System
- Permanent license invalidation
- Automatic termination on tampering
- Audit logging of revocation events
- Real-time status reporting

Core Files:
- `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`: Hardware binding, security checks
- `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`: License administration interface

Importance Score: 85/100 (Critical business logic for software monetization)

# license-workflow
License lifecycle management system implementing a multi-stage workflow for software licensing.
## License Creation & Validation Flow (85/100)
`01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using composite identifiers:
  - CPU serial
  - Motherboard ID
  - BIOS info
  - MAC address
- License binding to hardware profile
- Session-based validation caching
- Runtime anti-tampering protection
## License Server Operations (80/100)  
`original_server.mjs`
- Secure key generation in format: licenseId:expiryDate:signature
- License tier management:
  - Student tier
  - Professional tier
  - Enterprise tier
- Multi-stage verification workflow
- License migration pathway for legacy keys
## Protection Mechanisms (75/100)
- Anti-debugging implementation
- Virtual machine detection
- Memory protection checks
- Local encrypted storage for license data
- Hardware binding validation
- Rate limiting on verification attempts
## License States & Transitions
Valid license states:
- Active
- Expired
- Revoked
- Migrated
- Pending Activation
Key transitions:
- Initial activation
- Renewal
- Hardware migration
- Tier upgrade/downgrade
- Revocation
## License State Machine (Importance: 95/100)
Core workflow states and transitions:
1. Creation & Initial Binding
- Generates unique license on first activation
- Automatically binds to hardware using composite fingerprint
- Stores binding in secure format: {license_id}:{expiry_date}:{signature}
2. Validation Sequence
- Validates hardware binding matches stored fingerprint
- Checks expiration status and grace periods
- Verifies license tier permissions
- Handles offline validation (72-hour grace period)
3. Migration Handling
- Supports transitions between legacy and new formats
- Preserves binding and expiration data during migration
- Maintains tier permissions across versions
4. Revocation Process
- Server-side revocation management
- Handles license transfers between machines
- Enforces single-machine activation policy
## License Types & Rules (Importance: 85/100)
Tiered License Structure:
1. Student
2. Professional 
3. Enterprise
Each tier implements:
- Specific feature access controls
- Custom validation workflows
- Unique grace period handling
- Tier-specific migration rules
## Hardware Binding Components (Importance: 90/100)
Composite Fingerprint Elements:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard Serial
- BIOS ID
- MAC Address
Binding Implementation:
- First activation locks to hardware profile
- Cached in encrypted local storage
- Verified during runtime validation
- Used for transfer/migration decisions
