## License State Machine
- Manages license lifecycle through defined states:
  - Active: Valid and bound to hardware
  - Inactive: Temporarily disabled
  - Revoked: Permanently invalidated
  - Migrated: Converted from legacy format
  - Expired: Past termination date

## License Creation
- Hardware fingerprinting using CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address 
- Tiered license types: student, startup, professional, enterprise
- Format: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation

## Validation Workflow
1. Hardware binding verification
2. Multi-layer anti-debugging checks
3. Runtime integrity validation
4. VM/sandbox environment detection
5. Time-based execution control

## License Migration
- Legacy format conversion (containing '-' character)
- Metadata preservation during migration
- Automatic expiry parsing
- Migration audit trail maintenance

## Revocation System
- Permanent license invalidation
- Automatic termination on tampering
- Audit logging of revocation events
- Real-time status reporting
