## Core Hardware Fingerprinting Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Hardware Identifier Collection
Implementation in `CONFIRM_Integrated.py`:
- CPU ID extraction through system-level commands
- Motherboard serial number retrieval via BIOS/UEFI interface
- MAC address collection from primary network interface
- Platform-specific hardware identifier gathering

### Fingerprint Generation
- SHA-256 hashing of combined hardware identifiers:
  ```
  fingerprint = SHA256(CPU_ID + MB_SERIAL + MAC_ADDR)
  ```
- Unique machine signature creation for license binding
- Hardware-specific validation token generation

### License Binding Mechanism
Located in `server.mjs`:
- Hardware fingerprint verification against license records
- Machine-specific activation tokens
- Cross-reference of hardware identifiers during validation
- Prevention of multi-machine activation attempts

### Hardware Validation Workflow
1. Collection of system hardware identifiers
2. Generation of unique machine fingerprint
3. Server-side verification of hardware signature
4. License binding to specific hardware configuration

The fingerprinting system ensures:
- Single machine activation per license
- Hardware-locked license enforcement
- Prevention of license sharing across devices
- Secure hardware-based identity verification

# Hardware Fingerprinting Algorithms

Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Hardware Identification System
File: `CONFIRM_Integrated.py`

Primary fingerprinting components collect and hash:
- CPU ID extraction and validation
- Motherboard serial number identification 
- MAC address collection from primary network interface
- BIOS information gathering

The combined hardware identifiers create a unique machine signature through:
1. Multiple identifier collection
2. Cryptographic hashing of combined values
3. Machine-specific binding validation

## Hardware Binding Logic
File: `server.mjs`

License-to-hardware binding workflow:
1. Initial hardware fingerprint capture during activation
2. Two-way validation between client hardware and server
3. Permanent machine binding storage with encryption
4. Grace period allowance for temporary hardware changes

Key anti-tampering features:
- Multi-factor hardware verification
- Server-side fingerprint validation
- Local encrypted storage of binding data
- Hardware change detection and reporting

## Implementation Details

The fingerprinting system uses a combined approach:
1. Primary identifiers:
   - CPU ID
   - Motherboard serial
   - MAC address
2. Secondary validation:
   - BIOS information
   - Hardware configuration hash
   - System profile verification
