## Core Hardware Fingerprinting Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Hardware Identifier Collection
Implementation in `CONFIRM_Integrated.py`:
- CPU ID extraction through system-level commands
- Motherboard serial number retrieval via BIOS/UEFI interface
- MAC address collection from primary network interface
- Platform-specific hardware identifier gathering

### Fingerprint Generation
- SHA-256 hashing of combined hardware identifiers:
  ```
  fingerprint = SHA256(CPU_ID + MB_SERIAL + MAC_ADDR)
  ```
- Unique machine signature creation for license binding
- Hardware-specific validation token generation

### License Binding Mechanism
Located in `server.mjs`:
- Hardware fingerprint verification against license records
- Machine-specific activation tokens
- Cross-reference of hardware identifiers during validation
- Prevention of multi-machine activation attempts

### Hardware Validation Workflow
1. Collection of system hardware identifiers
2. Generation of unique machine fingerprint
3. Server-side verification of hardware signature
4. License binding to specific hardware configuration

The fingerprinting system ensures:
- Single machine activation per license
- Hardware-locked license enforcement
- Prevention of license sharing across devices
- Secure hardware-based identity verification
