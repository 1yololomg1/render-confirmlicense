### License Key Format
Multi-part structure:
```
{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}
```

### License States
```
- Active
- Expired
- Pending
```

### Hardware Binding Attributes

- Hardware fingerprint binding
- Secure local cache storage
- Manual override capability for admins

### License Validation Rules
1. Time-based expiration
2. Hardware fingerprint verification
3. Tier-specific access control
4. Optional manual approval workflow
5. Revocation support with reason tracking

## Core License Data Structure

1. License Entity
```
- licenseId: Unique identifier
- productTier: Student/Startup/Professional/Enterprise
- duration: 30/365 days
- hardwareFingerprint: Combined hardware identifiers
- status: Created/Pending/Active/Expired/Revoked
- activationDate: Initial binding date
- expiryDate: Calculated from duration
```

2. Hardware Binding Model
```
- cpuId: CPU identifier
- motherboardSerial: Motherboard unique ID
- macAddress: Network interface MAC
- biosInfo: BIOS version/serial
- combinedFingerprint: Cryptographic hash of all identifiers
```

3. License Tier Definitions
```
Student:
  - duration: 365
  - maxMachines: 1
  - offlineGracePeriod: 7

Startup:
  - duration: 30
  - maxMachines: 2
  - offlineGracePeriod: 3

Professional:
  - duration: 30/365
  - maxMachines: 3
  - offlineGracePeriod: 14

Enterprise:
  - duration: 30/365
  - maxMachines: 10
  - offlineGracePeriod: 30
```

4. License State Transitions
```
Created -> Pending Activation -> Hardware Bound -> Active
Active -> Expired
Active -> Revoked
```

5. Hardware Binding Rules
- One-to-one mapping between license and hardware fingerprint
- No concurrent activations on multiple machines
- Hardware changes require reactivation
- Grace period for temporary offline usage

The model implements strict machine binding with tiered access controls and state management for statistical analysis software licensing.
