Hardware Fingerprinting System:
- Generates unique machine identifiers using:
  - CPU ID extraction
  - Motherboard serial number collection
  - MAC address combination
- Hardware binding creates permanent license-to-machine association

Anti-Debugging Protection:
- Process monitoring system detects known debugger applications
- Multi-layered detection prevents runtime analysis
- Automatic termination on debugger detection

Runtime Integrity:
- Memory patching detection verifies code integrity
- Virtual machine/sandbox environment detection
- Time-based execution controls enforce license validity

Key Protection Rules:
1. Hardware fingerprints must include minimum 3 unique identifiers
2. License validation requires both local and remote verification
3. Tampering detection triggers immediate application termination
4. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing

File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
Importance Score: 85

Core Protection Components:
1. Hardware Fingerprint Generator
   - Machine-specific identifier creation
   - Permanent binding mechanism
   
2. Anti-Debug System
   - Process monitoring
   - Runtime analysis prevention
   
3. Integrity Verification
   - Memory validation
   - Environment verification
   - Time control enforcement
