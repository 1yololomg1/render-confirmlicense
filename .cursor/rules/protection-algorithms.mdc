Hardware Fingerprinting System:
- Generates unique machine identifiers using:
  - CPU ID extraction
  - Motherboard serial number collection
  - MAC address combination
- Hardware binding creates permanent license-to-machine association

Anti-Debugging Protection:
- Process monitoring system detects known debugger applications
- Multi-layered detection prevents runtime analysis
- Automatic termination on debugger detection

Runtime Integrity:
- Memory patching detection verifies code integrity
- Virtual machine/sandbox environment detection
- Time-based execution controls enforce license validity

Key Protection Rules:
1. Hardware fingerprints must include minimum 3 unique identifiers
2. License validation requires both local and remote verification
3. Tampering detection triggers immediate application termination
4. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing

File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
Importance Score: 85

Core Protection Components:
1. Hardware Fingerprint Generator
   - Machine-specific identifier creation
   - Permanent binding mechanism
   
2. Anti-Debug System
   - Process monitoring
   - Runtime analysis prevention
   
3. Integrity Verification
   - Memory validation
   - Environment verification
   - Time control enforcement

## Hardware Fingerprinting (Importance: 85)
The system implements multi-factor hardware identification using:
- CPU identifiers
- Motherboard serial numbers
- BIOS information
- MAC addresses

Location: 01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py

## Runtime Protection Systems (Importance: 90)
Multi-layered anti-tampering mechanisms:
- Active anti-debugging detection
- Virtual machine/sandbox environment detection
- Memory integrity verification
- Session-based validation with caching

## License Validation Architecture (Importance: 85)
Secure validation workflow:
1. Hardware binding verification against stored fingerprints
2. Multi-stage verification process
3. Encrypted local storage for license data
4. Anti-reverse engineering protections

Key formats: licenseId:expiryDate:signature
Location: original_server.mjs

## Protection Integration Layer (Importance: 80)
- Runtime integrity checking system
- Hardware-bound license enforcement
- Protection measure coordination
- Anti-tampering response handlers
