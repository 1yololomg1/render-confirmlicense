# license-protection-algorithms

Hardware Fingerprinting System (Importance Score: 90/100)
- Unique device identification using CPU ID + motherboard serial + MAC address hash
- Custom fingerprint validation algorithm specific to statistical workstations
- Hardware profile caching with tamper-resistant storage

Anti-Debugging Protection (Importance Score: 85/100)
- Process monitoring for statistical analysis debuggers and tools
- Memory integrity verification focused on statistical computation blocks
- Custom debugger detection for protecting proprietary algorithms
- Execution path validation against authorized installation paths

Runtime Protection Implementation (Importance Score: 80/100)
- Real-time monitoring of statistical processing modules
- License state validation during computation-intensive operations
- Memory protection for proprietary statistical methods
- Custom integrity checks for computational resource access

Core License Validation Logic (Importance Score: 85/100)
Files: protection_module.py, server.mjs
- Three-part key format (key:identifier:checksum)
- Hardware-bound license activation
- Academic vs. Commercial license type enforcement
- Custom expiration handling for subscription-based access

Key Protection Mechanisms:
1. Hardware Binding:
- Workstation-specific license activation
- Multi-factor hardware identification
- Profile persistence with integrity checking

2. Runtime Security:
- Statistical operation access control
- Computational resource management
- Memory tampering detection
- Process whitelist enforcement

3. License States:
- Academic/Student restrictions
- Professional/Enterprise capabilities
- Integration/OEM permissions
- Feature-based access control

Implementation enforces license compliance through hardware fingerprinting, prevents unauthorized analysis of statistical algorithms, and manages computational resource access based on license tier.
