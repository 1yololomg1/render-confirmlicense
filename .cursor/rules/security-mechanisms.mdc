# security-mechanisms

Core Protection System (Importance Score: 85/100)
- Hardware fingerprinting combining CPU ID, motherboard serial, and MAC address
- Anti-debugging monitoring with process blacklisting
- Runtime integrity verification for memory patching detection
- API hooking prevention mechanisms

License Validation System (Importance Score: 80/100)
- Custom key format validation (key:part2:part3) 
- Machine-specific binding with hardware identifiers
- Expiry management with time-based validation
- Integration with computational resource access control

Environment Security (Importance Score: 75/100)
- Analysis tool blacklisting
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
- Maximum execution time limits (1 hour)
- Execution path validation against whitelisted locations

Protection Response (Importance Score: 70/100)
- Graceful termination with memory cleanup
- Silent failure mechanisms to prevent analysis
- File integrity verification (1MB-500MB range)
- Process monitoring for unauthorized analysis

Implementation Components:
/protection_module.py
