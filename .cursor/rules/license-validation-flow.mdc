# license-validation-flow

Core multi-step license validation workflow enforcing hardware-bound licensing through local and server verification.

Importance Score: 85/100

## Validation Sequence
1. Local Cache Verification
- Checks securely stored license data
- Validates hardware fingerprint match
- Confirms license hasn't expired locally

2. Hardware Binding Verification
- Generates machine fingerprint using:
  - CPU ID
  - Motherboard serial
  - MAC address
  - Platform hardware identifiers
- Validates against bound hardware signature

3. Server-Side Validation (/server.mjs)
- Validates license key structure: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- Confirms license status (active/revoked)
- Verifies hardware binding matches
- Checks expiration date
- Enforces license tier restrictions

## License State Management
- Active: Valid license with matching hardware
- Expired: Beyond license duration
- Pending: Awaiting manual approval (Enterprise tier)
- Revoked: Administratively disabled

## Hardware Binding Implementation
- Uses SHA-256 hash of combined hardware identifiers
- Permanent binding unless administratively released
- Single machine activation enforcement
- Platform-specific hardware fingerprinting

## Tier-Specific Validation Rules
- Student/Startup: Automated validation
- Professional: Server verification required
- Enterprise: Manual approval workflow
- Integration/White-label: Custom binding rules

## Core Validation Steps
Importance Score: 90/100

1. Hardware Fingerprint Generation
- Combines CPU ID, motherboard serial, MAC address, and BIOS data
- Creates unique machine identifier for license binding
- Stores encrypted fingerprint in local cache

2. Local Cache Verification 
- Validates stored license data against hardware fingerprint
- Enables grace period for offline usage
- Detects tampering attempts through encryption validation

3. Server-Side Validation
- Two-way validation between client hardware and license server
- Confirms activation status and expiration
- Verifies hardware binding matches registered machine
- Enforces manual approval requirements for specific license tiers

## License States
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Initial Activation Flow
- License creation post-purchase
- Pending activation state
- Hardware binding process
- Active state confirmation

2. Ongoing Validation
- Periodic re-validation checks
- Grace period management for offline use
- Expiration enforcement
- Revocation handling

## Anti-Piracy Protection
Importance Score: 80/100

1. Machine Binding
- Permanent hardware fingerprint association
- Prevention of multiple machine activations
- Tampering detection through encrypted storage

2. Usage Control
- Tier-specific activation rules
- Product-specific duration enforcement
- Integration-specific binding requirements

3. Security Measures
- Cryptographic signature validation
- Combined validation factors
- Real-time server verification
