# license-validation-flow

Core multi-step license validation workflow enforcing hardware-bound licensing through local and server verification.

Importance Score: 85/100

## Validation Sequence
1. Local Cache Verification
- Checks securely stored license data
- Validates hardware fingerprint match
- Confirms license hasn't expired locally

2. Hardware Binding Verification
- Generates machine fingerprint using:
  - CPU ID
  - Motherboard serial
  - MAC address
  - Platform hardware identifiers
- Validates against bound hardware signature

3. Server-Side Validation (/server.mjs)
- Validates license key structure: `{licenseId}:{expiry}:{signature}`
- Confirms license status (active/revoked)
- Verifies hardware binding matches
- Checks expiration date
- Enforces license tier restrictions

## License State Management
- Active: Valid license with matching hardware
- Expired: Beyond license duration
- Pending: Awaiting manual approval (Enterprise tier)
- Revoked: Administratively disabled

## Hardware Binding Implementation
- Uses SHA-256 hash of combined hardware identifiers
- Permanent binding unless administratively released
- Single machine activation enforcement
- Platform-specific hardware fingerprinting

## Tier-Specific Validation Rules
- Student/Startup: Automated validation
- Professional: Server verification required
- Enterprise: Manual approval workflow
- Integration/White-label: Custom binding rules
