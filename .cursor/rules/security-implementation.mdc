# security-implementation

Core Security Components:

1. Anti-Tampering System (01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py)
- Runtime integrity verification with memory patching detection
- Process monitoring system for debugger application detection
- Automatic termination triggers on tampering detection
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Environment Protection
- Virtual machine and sandbox environment detection mechanisms
- Hardware-based validation using CPU ID and motherboard fingerprints
- MAC address verification for machine binding
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Cryptographic Validation Layer
- HMAC-SHA256 based license signature generation
- Multi-layer validation requiring both local and server verification
- Hardware-bound encryption keys tied to machine fingerprints
Importance Score: 95/100

Security Implementation Rules:
1. Multiple validation layers must pass for successful execution
2. Hardware fingerprinting uses combined identifiers (CPU+MB+MAC)
3. Tampering detection triggers immediate application termination
4. Virtual machine execution is blocked by default
5. License signatures require server-side verification
