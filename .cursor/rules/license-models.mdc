## License Types
- Student
- Startup 
- Professional
- Enterprise

Each license type is permanently bound to hardware configurations through multi-factor fingerprinting:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard serial
- MAC address

## License States
- Active
- Inactive
- Revoked
- Migrated

## Hardware Binding System
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using multiple machine identifiers
- Runtime integrity verification
- Anti-debugging protection layer
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
Importance Score: 90/100

## License Management Models
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`
- Hardware-bound license creation with machine fingerprinting
- License expiration tracking
- Feature set mapping per license tier
- Automated revocation handling
- License audit trail maintenance
Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Business Rules
1. Hardware binding is permanent and non-transferable
2. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing
3. Different feature sets per license tier
4. Automatic termination on tampering detection
5. Dual validation: local + server-side verification

# license-models
Importance Score: 90/100
## License Types and Tiers
- Student
- Professional
- Enterprise
Each tier implements specific access control and feature restrictions
## Hardware Binding Model
Composite hardware fingerprint using:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard Serial Number
- BIOS Identifier
- MAC Address
## License Key Format
Structured key composition:
`{license_id}:{expiry_date}:{signature}`
## Binding Rules
1. Single machine activation enforcement
2. Automatic hardware binding on first activation
3. 72-hour offline grace period allowance
4. Migration support for legacy license formats
## License Validation Workflow
1. Hardware fingerprint verification
2. Expiration checks
3. Grace period management
4. License tier validation
5. Secure cached state verification
## Storage Model
- Encrypted local storage for license cache
- Hardware-bound state persistence
- Secure validation tokens
Implementation Locations:
- 01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py: Core license model implementations
- server.mjs: Server-side license validation and management
- 01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py: Hardware binding protection

# license-models

## Core License Types (IMPORTANCE: 85)
- Student: Limited feature access
- Startup: Standard feature set with usage limits  
- Professional: Full feature access for individual use
- Enterprise: Multi-user deployment with custom validation rules

## Hardware Binding Model (IMPORTANCE: 90)
Hardware-based fingerprinting using:
- CPU identifier
- Motherboard serial number  
- MAC address
- Multiple identifier validation for enhanced security

## License Validation Rules
1. Primary Validation (01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py)
- Multi-tier verification with hardware fingerprinting
- Runtime integrity checks
- Anti-debugging protection
- VM/sandbox detection

2. Server-side Management (server.mjs)
- License migration handling
- Grace period management (72 hours offline)
- Automated revocation system
- Audit trail tracking

## License State Management
- Active/Inactive status tracking
- Expiration handling with grace periods
- Hardware binding verification
- Enterprise deployment monitoring
- Migration state tracking for legacy licenses

## Enterprise-Specific Extensions
- Custom validation rulesets
- Multi-seat license management
- Department-level access control
- License pool allocation tracking
