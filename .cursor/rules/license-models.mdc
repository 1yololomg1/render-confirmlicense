# license-models

## License Types
- Student
- Startup 
- Professional
- Enterprise

Each license type is permanently bound to hardware configurations through multi-factor fingerprinting:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard serial
- MAC address

## License States
- Active
- Inactive
- Revoked
- Migrated

## Hardware Binding System
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using multiple machine identifiers
- Runtime integrity verification
- Anti-debugging protection layer
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
Importance Score: 90/100

## License Management Models
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`
- Hardware-bound license creation with machine fingerprinting
- License expiration tracking
- Feature set mapping per license tier
- Automated revocation handling
- License audit trail maintenance
Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Business Rules
1. Hardware binding is permanent and non-transferable
2. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing
3. Different feature sets per license tier
4. Automatic termination on tampering detection
5. Dual validation: local + server-side verification
