## License Types
- Student
- Startup 
- Professional
- Enterprise

Each license type is permanently bound to hardware configurations through multi-factor fingerprinting:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard serial
- MAC address

## License States
- Active
- Inactive
- Revoked
- Migrated

## Hardware Binding System
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using multiple machine identifiers
- Runtime integrity verification
- Anti-debugging protection layer
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
Importance Score: 90/100

## License Management Models
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`
- Hardware-bound license creation with machine fingerprinting
- License expiration tracking
- Feature set mapping per license tier
- Automated revocation handling
- License audit trail maintenance
Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Business Rules
1. Hardware binding is permanent and non-transferable
2. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing
3. Different feature sets per license tier
4. Automatic termination on tampering detection
5. Dual validation: local + server-side verification

Importance Score: 85/100
## License Model Structure
The system implements a hardware-bound licensing system with multiple tiers:
- Student
- Startup
- Professional  
- Enterprise
Each license incorporates:
- Hardware fingerprinting using multiple identifiers
  - CPU ID
  - Motherboard serial
  - BIOS information
  - MAC address binding
- Custom expiry calculation per tier
- Migration support between formats
- Grace period handling for hardware changes
## Core Components
### Hardware Binding System
Located in 01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py:
- Multi-factor hardware fingerprinting
- Runtime integrity validation
- Anti-debugging protection
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
### License Server
Located in server.mjs:
- Combined hardware-bound key generation
- Legacy format migration system
- Tier-based expiry management
- Grace period validation logic
- Hardware binding verification
## Business Workflows
1. License Binding
- Hardware identifier collection
- Secure fingerprint generation
- License key combination
- Local storage encryption
2. License Migration
- Legacy format detection
- Permission mapping
- Expiry date preservation
- Audit trail maintenance
3. Hardware Change Management
- Grace period activation
- Binding revalidation
- Migration tracking
- Hardware change limits

## Core License Types
The licensing system supports multiple tiers with distinct hardware binding characteristics:
- Student licenses
- Startup licenses 
- Professional licenses
- Enterprise licenses

Each license type integrates with the hardware binding validation system for unique machine fingerprinting and binding enforcement.

## Hardware Binding Model
Hardware-based license binding implemented through:
- Machine fingerprinting mechanisms in protection_module.py
- Binding state tracking in license_admin_secure.html
- License mobility controls via admin_unbind_license.py

## License State Management
License models maintain binding relationships through:
1. Multi-tier validation system
2. Machine ID verification 
3. Binding enforcement rules
4. Time-based expiration tracking
5. Audit trail for binding changes

## License Mobility Controls
License transfer and unbinding governed by:
- Timestamp validation for unbinding requests
- Machine binding state transitions
- Reactivation workflows
- Audit logging of binding changes

Importance Score: 85/100
