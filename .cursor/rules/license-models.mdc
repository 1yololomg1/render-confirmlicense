## License Types
- Student
- Startup 
- Professional
- Enterprise

Each license type is permanently bound to hardware configurations through multi-factor fingerprinting:
- CPU ID
- Motherboard serial
- MAC address

## License States
- Active
- Inactive
- Revoked
- Migrated

## Hardware Binding System
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py`
- Hardware fingerprint generation using multiple machine identifiers
- Runtime integrity verification
- Anti-debugging protection layer
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection
Importance Score: 90/100

## License Management Models
File: `01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py`
- Hardware-bound license creation with machine fingerprinting
- License expiration tracking
- Feature set mapping per license tier
- Automated revocation handling
- License audit trail maintenance
Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Business Rules
1. Hardware binding is permanent and non-transferable
2. Multiple validation layers prevent license sharing
3. Different feature sets per license tier
4. Automatic termination on tampering detection
5. Dual validation: local + server-side verification

- MAC Address
## License Key Format
Structured key composition:
`{license_id}:{expiry_date}:{signature}`
## Binding Rules
1. Single machine activation enforcement
2. Automatic hardware binding on first activation
3. 72-hour offline grace period allowance
4. Migration support for legacy license formats
## License Validation Workflow
1. Hardware fingerprint verification
2. Expiration checks
3. Grace period management
4. License tier validation
5. Secure cached state verification
## Storage Model
- Encrypted local storage for license cache
- Hardware-bound state persistence
- Secure validation tokens
Implementation Locations:
- 01_SOURCE_CODE/license_manager_gui.py: Core license model implementations
- server.mjs: Server-side license validation and management

## License Model Structure

The system implements a hardware-bound licensing system with multiple tiers:
- Student
- Startup
- Professional  
- Enterprise

Each license incorporates:
- Hardware fingerprinting using multiple identifiers
  - CPU ID
  - Motherboard serial
  - BIOS information
  - MAC address binding
- Custom expiry calculation per tier
- Migration support between formats
- Grace period handling for hardware changes

## Core Components

### Hardware Binding System
Located in 01_SOURCE_CODE/protection_module.py:
- Multi-factor hardware fingerprinting
- Runtime integrity validation
- Anti-debugging protection
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox environment detection

### License Server
Located in server.mjs:
- Combined hardware-bound key generation
- Legacy format migration system
- Tier-based expiry management
- Grace period validation logic
- Hardware binding verification

## Business Workflows

1. License Binding
- Hardware identifier collection
- Secure fingerprint generation
- License key combination
- Local storage encryption

2. License Migration
